From our first meeting to the final closing, she demonstrated exceptional market knowledge and always had our best interests at heart. She helped us find our dream home in DHA Phase 6 and negotiated a price well below what we expected to pay. We couldnt be happier with the service we received.',

He understood exactly what we were looking for and didn\'t waste our time showing properties that didn\'t meet our criteria. His knowledge of the area and building qualities was impressive. Throughout the process, he was responsive, professional, and patient. Highly recommend UrbanNest for anyone looking to buy or rent in Lahore.',

Her marketing strategy and staging suggestions resulted in multiple offers within the first week, and we ultimately sold for above asking price. She handled all aspects of the transaction with professionalism and made what could have been a stressful process smooth and straightforward.

    text: 'We were relocating from Karachi to Lahore and needed to find a rental home quickly. Sana took the time to understand our family\'s needs and preferences, and then arranged a full day of viewings that were all spot-on. She negotiated favorable terms with the landlord and even helped us connect with contractors for some minor renovations before we moved in. The level of service went far beyond what we expected. We\'re now looking to buy a home in Lahore and wouldn\'t consider working with any other agency.',

    text: 'I purchased a residential plot in DHA Phase 8 through UrbanNest Realty and am very satisfied with the service I received. Zara was knowledgeable about the area\'s development plans and helped me select a plot with good appreciation potential. She guided me through the documentation process and made sure everything was in order. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that there were some delays in the process, though these were mostly due to external factors.',

We did eventually find a good space, but the process took longer than I expected, and there were some communication gaps along the way. I appreciate their help but think there could be improvements in how they manage the timeline and client expectations.',
